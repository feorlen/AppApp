#AppApp
AppApp is the first __completely native__ iOS client for ADN. We hope you love it as much as we do. For announcements follow [@appapp](http://alpha.app.net/appapp) on App.net.

## Important
The AppApp team decided to keep the code base open for the public. However, due to the nation of the stuff we are doing, we had to make a decision to start keeping some parts private / available only for the core team.

The primary reason for this: Advanced services like integrating __Apple Push Notifications__ require credentials, certificates and other things, that must not be made available publicly.

We have started to move those parts of our code base to a __Git submodule__ which will only be available for the core team.

However, we do include a compiled version of these parts as a static library, ready for you to compile and run. We've also configured the Xcode project so that you can leverage the Themes to enable the use of the static library or – if you are a member of the core team – build with source.

### Core Contributors
In order to check out the complete AppApp code base including the __Confidentials__:

1. Clone the publicly available code: `git clone git@github.com:sneakyness/AppApp.git`
2. CD into the project root: `cd AppApp`
3. Get the confidential sources folder: `git submodule update -i --recursive`

Notes:
* For step 3 you need to be a member of the core team. Ping [@ralf](http://alpha.app.net/ralf) if you need assistance.

We are confident, that this procedure will balance both our requirements and supporting the public with a jump start into App.net development.

If you make changes __to the submodule__, please keep in mind that you have to follow these steps in this exact order:

1. Run `build.sh` in the submodule's folder. This will build the static library.
2. Add, commit and push the submodule upstream.
3. Add, commit and push the super project (AppApp.git) upstream.
